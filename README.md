## 🎯 What This Tool Does

**The "Resultant Set of Policy" for Intune** - Understand **WHAT should be configured and WHY** on device based on all assigned apps, policies, scripts, groups and filters.

### Complete Device Intelligence (v4.x)
**Device**: Hardware, OS, storage, network, sync, Autopilot, enrollment type, MDE status  
**Users**: Primary + logged-in users, group memberships with dynamic rules  
**Apps**: All Assignments for Device with install status, Win32 scripts (install/uninstall/detection/requirement), filters, application information  
**Policies**: All Assignments for Device with Complete settings for few policy types (e.g. Settings Catalog, OMA-URI), **conflict detection** ⭐  
**Scripts**: All Assignments for Device Remediation/platform/shell scripts (clear text script content, **execution output** with Remediations scripts)  
**Assignments**: Full chain (groups, filters, impact counts, dynamic rules)

### Hero Features (New in v4.x)
🎨 **HTML Reports** - Beautiful, searchable, shareable (replaced WPF GUI)  
🔍 **Universal Search & Filter** - **Search/filter** HTML tables **by ANY data** (names, settings, tooltips, policy content)  
🎯 **Interactive Tooltips** - Hover on -tooltips on top cards + **click any table row for detailed popup window**  
⭐ **Settings Catalog Conflict Detection** - Detects conflicts, duplicates, additive settings  
💎 **Win32App Script Visibility** - Install/uninstall scripts (Jan 2026 Graph API), Detection, Requirement scripts  
🪗 **Remediation Script Output** - See Detection, Remediation scripts AND actual execution results  
📚 **Living Documentation** - Self-contained HTML reports as configuration reference  
📸 **Configuration Baselines** - Save snapshots for comparison and rollback  
🌍 **Cross-Platform** - Windows, macOS (apps, shell scripts, .plist), iOS, Android  
🎯 **Three Report Types** - Minimal (quick), Normal (standard), Extended (full intelligence)

### Use Cases
**Troubleshooting** • **Documentation & Baselines** • **Incident Response** • **Change Management** • **Auditing**

**Breaking from v3.0**: WPF GUI → HTML reports (saved to `reports/` folder) • PowerShell 7.x + 5.1 support

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

**~98% of v4.0 code written by Agentic AI** (GitHub Copilot, GPT-5.1-Codex, Claude Sonnet 4.5)

This project demonstrates true human-AI collaboration in software development. The complete WPF → HTML transformation with new features took only few days of intensive collaborative work.

**Developer's Role** (Petri Paavola):
- 🎯 Vision and architecture decisions
- 📋 Feature requirements and specifications
- 🔌 Microsoft Graph API endpoints and data structures
- 📊 Example JSON data and API responses
- ✅ Code review and validation
- 🔍 Quality assurance and sanity checks
- 🧪 Testing and verification
- 📊 Final approval on all changes

**AI's Role**:
- 💻 Code implementation
- 🔬 **JSON data schema analysis and parsing** (e.g., Settings Catalog nested structures)
- 💡 Technical suggestions and approaches
- 🔧 Refactoring and optimization
- 🐛 Bug fixes
- 📝 Documentation generation

**The Reality**: True 50-50 collaboration - Developer provided domain expertise (Graph API knowledge, Intune data structures, example JSON data), AI analyzed the data schemas and transformed that into working code. For example, Settings Catalog parsing logic was 100% AI-generated after analyzing the JSON structure. AI suggested approaches and implementation strategies, developer made final decisions and validated everything. Neither worked autonomously.
